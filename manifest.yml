## NOTES:
#
#   • The app name will be substituted by what you type on Bluemix DevOps Services
#     deploy page.
#
#   • I'm using the "noop-buildpack" with minimum "memory" and "disk-quota" because I
#     don't need a real runtime. All my logic will happen on a Docker container, while the
#     purpose of this app is just to hold together the "services" and expose their
#     credentials at once to the Docker container. As a VCAP structure and environment
#     variables. See the `admin/deploy` script to learn how to bind this app to several
#     containers.
#
#   • The "env" block here is just to show you how to define additional environment
#     variables.
#
#   • The "declared-services" block is ignored by `cf push`, but is used by
#     Bluemix DevOps Services to automatically provision things.
#
#   • Discover services "label" and "plan" using `cf marketplace` command.
#
#   • The `admin/deploy` script uses the info on this CloudFoundry manifest.yml file
#     when calls `cf push`
